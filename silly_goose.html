<h1> Hey Cutie, Happy Valentines Day!‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>
  
<div style="float: left; width: 50%">
  <p>I love you so much. It's a little embarassing frankly, like from the moment I wake up I think about you.
    You are so incredibly smart, beautiful, and silly! You really make me feel like the luckiest guy in the world.
    These last 6-7 months have been incredibly wonderful, so here's to many more months of awesome adventures!
