<h1> Hey Cutie, Happy Valentines Day!‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>
  
<div style="float: left; width: 50%">
  <p>I love you so much. It's a little embarassing frankly, like every morning 
    I wake up I think about you and I can't wait to talk to you at the end of every day.
    You are so incredibly smart, beautiful, silly, but most of all you just make me feel like the luckiest guy in the world.
    These last 6-7 months have been incredibly wonderful, so here's to many more months of awesome adventures!
  </p>

  <p>I'm sorry I couldn't see you on valentines day, but I hope I can make it up to you by planning a super-fun date for us. So here you are:</p>
